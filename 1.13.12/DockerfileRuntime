# This image doesn't use Alpine as the base, so we are going to reference the gearbox-base container indirectly.

# 1. First reference the gearbox-base image.
FROM gearboxworks/gearbox-base:alpine-3.7 as gearbox-base

# 2. Next reference the third party image.
FROM nginx:1.13.12-alpine

# 3. Copy the build directory over from gearbox-base image.
COPY --from=gearbox-base /build /build

# 4. Run the build-base.sh script to set everything up.
RUN /bin/sh /build/build-base.sh

# 5. Now copy the local files specific to the nginx:1.15.0-alpine container.
COPY build /build
COPY container.json /build/container.json

# 6. Set up env variables.
MAINTAINER Gearbox Team <team@gearbox.works>
ENV GEARBOX_CONTAINER_NAME "docker-proxy"
ENV GEARBOX_CONTAINER_VERSION "1.13.12"

# 7. Run the build-proxy.sh script to set everything up.
RUN /bin/sh /build/build-proxy.sh

# 8. Expose ports.
